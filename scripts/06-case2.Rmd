## Pacotes

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Dados

```{r}
readr::read_csv("../dados/pe_agosto2019-simulado.xlsx")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
